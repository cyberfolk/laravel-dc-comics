# DC Comics - Replica web-site

**Initial commit**: 07/05/23

**Tecnologie:** Laravel, PHP, Blade, MySql, Javascript, HTML, CSS e Bootstrap.

**Info:** ü¶∏üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è DC Comics! A project that accompanied us during the Boolean journey, has been updated from time to time with the technology learned in lessons, this is the latest version. In this exercise we implemented the CRUD (create/read/update/delete) to manage the persistence of the Comics in the Database then through the routes and the PageControler we managed the navigation between the various pages of the site. Finally, with the Blade template, I was able to populate the html code dynamically.
